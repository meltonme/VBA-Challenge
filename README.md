For this challenge I used VBA Scripting to analyze generated stock market data. 

My objective was to create a loop that looped through all the stock data per year to retrieve the following information: 
  1. The ticker symbol
  2. Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of the year to the closing price at the end of the year
  3. The percentage change from the opening price to the closing price
  4. The total stock volume for each stock/ticker

I also created functionality to return other specific values in the dataset:
  1. Greatest Percent Increase, Greatest Percent Decrease, and Greatest Total Volume for each year
  2. Created conditional formating to highlight positive and negative change in the change between the opening and close price.
